Q1 What are Data Types?
>A data type is a set of values and a set of operations defined on data. An implementation of a data type is an expression of data and operations in terms of a specific programming language such as Java, C ++, or Python.

Q2 Name four of the main data types in Python
>Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files, and sets are generally considered the main types of data. Types, None, and Booleans are sometimes also classified this way. The integer, floating-point, complex, fraction and decimal are numerical data types and simple strings and Unicode strings in Python 2 and text strings and byte strings in Python 3 are the types of string data types.

Q3 Why are these data types known as Python’s core data types?
>They are known as the core data types because they are part of the Python language itself and are always available to create other objects, you usually need to call functions in imported modules.Most of the data types have a specific syntax for generating objects: “spam”, for example, is an expression that creates a string and determines the set of operations that can be applied to it. For this reason, main types are built into Python syntax. Instead, you must call the built-in open function to create a file object.
